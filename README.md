# Undercover Game App

Welcome to the **Undercover Game App**, a fun and engaging mobile game inspired by the popular social deduction game "Undercover". This Android application allows players to enjoy a digital version of the game where they must deduce the roles of their friends while hiding their own identities. Built using Android Studio, this app provides an interactive experience with a user-friendly interface.

## Overview

The Undercover Game App is designed for 5 players who take on the roles of either civilians or infiltrators (undercovers). Each player receives a secret word, and the goal is to identify the undercover players while avoiding elimination. The game consists of several stages:

- **Instruction Phase**: Players are introduced to the game rules.
- **Card Selection**: Players choose their characters and receive secret words.
- **Description Time**: Players describe their secret words with a single word to help others guess their roles.
- **Elimination Time**: Players vote to eliminate suspected undercover players, with confirmation pop-ups and results.
- **Summary**: The game concludes with a summary screen revealing the winner (Civilians or Undercovers) and the roles of all players.

The game ends when all undercover players are eliminated (Civilians win) or when only one civilian and one undercover remain (Undercovers win).

## Features

- **Multiplayer Interaction**: Supports up to 5 players with dynamic role assignment.
- **Secret Word System**: Each player gets a unique word (e.g., "Iron Man" for undercover, "Spider-Man" for civilian).
- **Voting Mechanism**: Players can vote to eliminate others with confirmation dialogs.
- **Win Conditions**: Clear win conditions for both Civilians and Undercovers.
- **Summary Screen**: Displays the final results, including who won and the roles of all players.
